# Overview

Imageinator is designed to solve a problem, having multiple bots / sources reference and memory manage the same collection of images. Initially generated by Wizard in JS, the code was moved to Java to offer more scalability and performance. This is set up to be able to generate any kind of image and aggressively cache assets in memory for higher performance.

As of now, this image generator is designed for Clash of Clans and includes the following:

- Player profile display
- Player troops showcase
- Player XP (with level)

The plan next is to add clan related images and hopefully expand to builder base stats as well.

# How to use

- `make build` to generate the jar run the docker build
- `make run` starts the docker container in detached mode on port 8080
- `make stop` to stop the running container (and the microservice)
